    * State of charge (%)
    * Consumed amp hours
    * Auxilary input (temperature, midpoint voltage, or starter battery voltage)
* Smart Battery Sense
    * Voltage
    * Temperature (°C)
* Solar Charger (Tested with BlueSolar 75/15):
    * Charger State (Off, Bulk, Absorption, Float)

## Install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install victron_ble
```

## Additional systemd requirements

To use systemd watchdog feature, you need to install libsystemd-dev on your system.

## Usage

To be able to decrypt the contents of the advertisement, you'll need to first fetch the per-device encryption key from the official Victron application. The method to do this will vary per platform, instructions below:

#### Fetching Keys
 
**OSX**

[MacOS's bleak backend](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/macos.html) uses a bluetooth UUID address instead of the more traditional MAC address to identify bluetooth devices. This UUID address is often unique to the device scanned *and* the device being scanned such that it cannot be used to connect to the same device from another computer. 

If you are going to use `victron-ble` on the same Mac computer as you have the Victron app on, follow the instructions below to retrieve the address UUID and advertisement key:

1. Install the Victron app from the Mac App Store
2. Pair with your device at least once to transfer keys
3. Run the following from Terminal to dump the known keys (install `sqlite3` via Homebrew)
```bash
❯ sqlite3 ~/Library/Containers/com.victronenergy.victronconnect.mac/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Victron\ Energy/Victron\ Connect/d25b6546b47ebb21a04ff86a2c4fbb76.sqlite 'select address,advertisementKey from advertisementKeys inner join macAddresses on advertisementKeys.macAddress == macAddresses.macAddress'

{763aeff5-1334-e64a-ab30-a0f478s20fe1}|0df4d0395b7d1a876c0c33ecb9e70dcd
❯
```

If you are going to use `victron-ble` on a different non-MacOS computer than the one with the Victron app (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi), follow these instructions to obtain the bluetooth MAC address and advertisement key instead:

1. Install the Victron app from the Mac App Store
2. Pair with your device at least once to transfer keys
3. Run the following from Terminal to dump the known keys (install `sqlite3` via Homebrew)
```bash
❯ sqlite3 ~/Library/Containers/com.victronenergy.victronconnect.mac/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Victron\ Energy/Victron\ Connect/d25b6546b47ebb21a04ff86a2c4fbb76.sqlite 'select macAddress,advertisementKey from advertisementKeys'

a0f478020fe1|0df4d0395b7d1a876c0c33ecb9e70dcd
❯
```

**Linux**

1. Download the Victron AppImage app from the Victron website.
2. Pair with your device at least once to transfer keys
3. Run the following from a terminal to dump the known keys (install `sqlite3` via your package manager)
```bash
❯ sqlite3 ~/.local/share/Victron\ Energy/Victron\ Connect/d25b6546b47ebb21a04ff86a2c4fbb76.sqlite 'select address,advertisementKey from advertisementKeys inner join macAddresses on advertisementKeys.macAddress == macAddresses.macAddress'

A0:F4:78:02:0F:E1|0df4d0395b7d1a876c0c33ecb9e70dcd
❯
```

**Windows**

1. Download the VictronConnect installer from the Victron website and install.
2. Pair with your device at least once to transfer keys
3. Open Explorer, navigate to ```%AppData%\Local\Victron Energy\Victron Connect\```
4. Open [SQLite Viewer](https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/) in a web browser of your choice
5. Drag and drop the ```d25b6546b47ebb21a04ff86a2c4fbb76.sqlite``` file from Explorer into the SQLite Viewer window


#### Reading data

The project ships with a standalone CLI that can be used to print device data to the console. 

```bash
# Will show all discovered Victron devices with Instant Readout enabled, their names, and IDs
$ > victron-ble discover 
763aeff5-1334-e64a-ab30-a0f478s20fe1: SmartShunt HT4531A246S
...


# Dump data for a particular device (replace the ID and key with your own)
$ > victron-ble read "763aeff5-1334-e64a-ab30-a0f478s20fe1@0df4d0395b7d1a876c0c33ecb9e70dcd"

```

To consume this project as a library, you can import the particular parser for your device:
```py
from victron_ble.devices import detect_device_type

data = <ble advertisement data>
parser = detect_device_type(data)
parsed_data = parser(<key>).parse(<ble advertisement data>)
```

## Development

If you'd like to help support a new device, collect the following and create a new Github issue:

1. Run `victron-ble discover` to find the ID of the device you'd like to support
2. Run `victron-ble dump <ID>` for a few minutes while collecting corresponding screenshots from the official apps instant readout to identify the current values
